# Forge-Race
Gametype for Halo Reach based on Ultimate Chicken Horse

Code is for the Reach Variant Tool

Recommended for 8+ players.
In this gametype players swap between placing obstacles on a course and racing on said obstacle course. 
The course gets progressively more chaotic with a wide variety of items.
Obstacles cost in-game money, but getting to the end of the course earns more money to buy better obstacles.
But if everyone makes it to the end, no money is earned. This incentivises not making the course too easy.
